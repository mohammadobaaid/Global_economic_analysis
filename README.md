# Global Economic Analysis: Cost of Living Disparities (2025)

## 📌 Overview
As an Economics student, I am interested in how Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and inflation affect real-world living costs. This project analyzes global cost-of-living data to identify outliers and economic anomalies across different cities.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python**: Pandas (Data Manipulation), Matplotlib (Visualization)
* **SQL (SQLite)**: Database construction and querying
* **ETL Pipeline**: Automated extraction from CSV to SQL Database

## 📊 Key Findings
* **Data Ingestion**: Built a pipeline to clean raw CSV data and load it into a persistent SQL database.
* **Analysis**: Queried the database to rank cities by a standardized "Meal Price Index" (Column x1).
* **Insight**: The analysis identified **Turkmenabat** as a significant outlier. This likely reflects hyperinflation or official vs. black-market currency rate discrepancies, rather than standard market pricing.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install pandas matplotlib`
3.  Run the notebook `project_final.ipynb` to generate the database and charts.
